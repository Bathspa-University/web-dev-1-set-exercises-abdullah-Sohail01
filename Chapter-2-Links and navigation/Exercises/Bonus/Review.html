 <p>I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I kept put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, 
    it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous but that won't stop you from having fun watching it. 
    The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series!
     It's a Spanish show but you can either watch it with subtitles or watch it dubbed in English. Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!</p>

<p>Some fellow critics think themself to criticise it but they even know about what it's about. 
If you want to watch the show without spoilers i can guarantee your goosebumps and emotions. Intense drama makes you on the edge of the seat experience. 
I have watched GOT,Breaking bad etc series but i first I watched this series there is nothing compatible with this. 
I still want these types of shows looking for but cant get that intense and heart pumping and blood pressure increasing shows.
Finally I can only assure you that never hear the fellow critics now do yourself a favour watch this goddamn show.
 A kind suggestion if you loved this watch prison break also you must live that too.</p>

<p>The first season was great, a solid 9. It was kind of a spin on Inside Man, my favorite Spike Lee movie (closely followed by Malcolm X).
But already in the second season the show metaphorically jumps the shark when a character literally jumps a motorcycle. 
Things quickly go south from there.
Season 2 had a natural ending. But of course Netflix has to keep beating that dead horse. Season 3 onward make no sense whatsoever.
